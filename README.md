# 2D spiking network model for working memory
- This model has 2D neurons, which can represent 2D features by persistent activity in working memory.

- The model needs some fine-tune on parameters to produce binding error. I am tired of tuning parameters and just give up.

- Thank Da-Hui Wang@BNU for instruction, thank Mengya Zhang@BNU for technical support.
